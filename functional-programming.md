# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes on using pure functions, immutable data, and higher-order functions. If you are looking to learn functional programming, here are some of the most important things and concepts to start with:

Pure functions: In functional programming, pure functions are the building blocks. Pure functions are functions that take inputs and produce outputs without changing anything else. They have no side effects, and the output of the function solely depends on the input parameters.

Immutability: In functional programming, data is immutable. This means that once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. This approach helps to avoid unexpected changes to data and simplifies reasoning about the behavior of the code.

Higher-order functions: Functions in functional programming are first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed around as arguments to other functions or returned as values from functions. This concept is called higher-order functions and is an essential concept in functional programming.

Recursion: Recursion is a powerful technique in functional programming. It is the process of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems until the base case is reached.

Functional data structures: Functional programming emphasizes on using immutable data structures. Some of the most commonly used functional data structures include linked lists, trees, and maps.

Laziness: Laziness is a concept in functional programming that allows the evaluation of expressions to be delayed until the result is actually needed. This approach can lead to better performance and more efficient memory usage.

Lambda calculus: Lambda calculus is a formal system that provides a mathematical foundation for functional programming. It is a simple but powerful way of defining functions and expressing computations.

Type systems: Functional programming languages typically have strong, static type systems. These systems provide a way of ensuring that values are used in the way they are intended, and that type errors are caught at compile time rather than at runtime.

Monads: Monads are a concept in functional programming that provide a way of encapsulating effects and sequencing computations. They are a powerful tool for managing side effects in functional programming.

Composability: Functional programming emphasizes on building small, composable functions that can be combined to create more complex functionality. This approach makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the code and to build more maintainable systems.
