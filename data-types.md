# Data Types

Elixir is a dynamically typed programming language that supports the following data types:

- Integer: Integers are whole numbers without decimal points. They can be positive, negative, or zero.
- Float: Floats are numbers with decimal points. They are represented as 64-bit double precision numbers.
- Boolean: Booleans are either true or false.
- Atom: An atom is a constant whose name is its own value. Atoms are often used to represent keywords or status codes
- List: A list is a collection of elements enclosed in square brackets [ ]. Lists can contain elements of different data types.
- Tuple: A tuple is a collection of elements enclosed in curly braces { }. Tuples can contain elements of different data types and have a fixed number of elements.
- Map: A map is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in %{}. Maps are often used to represent complex data structures
- PID: A PID (process identifier) is a unique identifier for a process in Elixir.
- Reference: A reference is a unique identifier generated by the system. References are often used to identify messages between processes.
- Function: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions in Elixir are first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and stored in variables.
