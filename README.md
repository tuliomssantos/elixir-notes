## What is Elixir?

Elixir is a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). It is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy to maintain. If you are looking to learn Elixir, here are some of the main concepts and knowledge areas to start with:

1.  Functional programming: Elixir is a functional programming language, which means that functions are first-class citizens, and the language emphasizes the use of immutable data structures and pure functions.
    
2.  Concurrency and parallelism: Elixir is designed to handle concurrency and parallelism out-of-the-box. This means that it is easy to write code that can run concurrently, and that can take advantage of multi-core processors.
    
3.  OTP: OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of libraries and tools that is built on top of Erlang, and provides a powerful set of abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant systems. Elixir makes use of OTP, and provides a high-level, easy-to-use API for working with OTP concepts such as processes, supervisors, and applications.
    
4.  Phoenix Framework: Phoenix is a web framework for Elixir that is inspired by Ruby on Rails. It provides a set of conventions and tools for building web applications quickly and efficiently, while also being scalable and fault-tolerant.
    
5.  Mix: Mix is Elixir's build tool and package manager. It provides a simple way to create new Elixir projects, manage dependencies, and run tests.
    
6.  Pattern matching: Pattern matching is a powerful feature of Elixir that allows you to match on the shape of data structures and execute different code depending on the match. Pattern matching is used extensively in Elixir, and is an important concept to master.
    
7.  Ecto: Ecto is a database wrapper and query builder for Elixir. It provides a simple, intuitive API for working with databases, and supports a wide range of database systems.
    
8.  Macros: Macros are a feature of Elixir that allow you to define new syntax and transform code at compile-time. Macros can be used to simplify code, create DSLs (domain-specific languages), and provide a way to define new abstractions.
    
9.  Testing: Elixir has a strong testing culture, and provides a robust testing framework out-of-the-box. It is important to learn how to write tests for Elixir code to ensure that it is correct and maintainable.
    

Overall, Elixir is a powerful and versatile language that is well-suited for building distributed, fault-tolerant systems. Learning Elixir requires a solid foundation in functional programming concepts, as well as an understanding of the tools and libraries that are specific to the Elixir ecosystem.

## Learning Roadmap

### Elixir Core
  - Fundamentals (Types, Pattern Matching, Pipe Operator, Functions, Modules)
  - Data Structures (Structs, Enum, Lists, Tuples, Maps, Keyword Lists, Sets)
  - [Control Structures](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/control_structures)
  - Unit Testing (ExUnit)

### Overall 

- Learn the basics of functional programming: Before you start programming with Elixir, it's important to understand the basics of functional programming. Elixir is a functional language that is built on top of the Erlang virtual machine, so understanding the functional programming concepts will help you understand Elixir better.
- Install Elixir: Install Elixir on your computer by following the instructions on the official website (https://elixir-lang.org/install.html). Elixir is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Learn the Elixir syntax: The Elixir syntax is similar to Ruby, so if you're familiar with Ruby, you'll find Elixir easy to learn. However, if you're not familiar with Ruby, you can still learn Elixir by reading the Elixir documentation and tutorials.
- Study the OTP: OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of libraries and tools that comes with Erlang and Elixir. OTP provides a set of abstractions for building scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed systems. Understanding the OTP is essential if you want to build large-scale applications with Elixir.
- Build a simple Elixir application: Start by building a simple Elixir application to get a feel for the language. You can build a command-line application, a web application, or a distributed system. The Elixir documentation has several examples that you can follow.
- Learn Phoenix: Phoenix is a web framework for Elixir that is inspired by Ruby on Rails. Phoenix is built on top of Elixir and provides a set of tools for building scalable and fault-tolerant web applications. Learning Phoenix is essential if you want to build web applications with Elixir.
- Learn Ecto: Ecto is a database library for Elixir that provides a set of abstractions for working with databases. Ecto is built on top of the OTP and provides a set of tools for building scalable and fault-tolerant database applications. Learning Ecto is essential if you want to build database applications with Elixir.
- Read Elixir books and blogs: There are several books and blogs that cover Elixir in-depth. Some of the popular books include "Programming Elixir" by Dave Thomas, "Elixir in Action" by Saša Jurić, and "Metaprogramming Elixir" by Chris McCord. Reading Elixir books and blogs will help you learn advanced topics and best practices.
- Join Elixir communities: Join online communities such as the Elixir Forum, Elixir Slack, and Elixir Discord to interact with other Elixir developers. The Elixir community is very friendly and helpful, and you'll get a lot of support from the community.
