# Elixir Interactive Shell

The Elixir Interactive Shell, also known as the IEx shell, is a command-line interface that allows you to interactively execute Elixir code and inspect the results. The IEx shell is a powerful tool for exploring the Elixir language and experimenting with code.

To start the IEx shell, you can simply open a terminal window and type iex at the command prompt. This will start the shell and display a prompt where you can enter Elixir code. For example, you can enter 1 + 2 and press enter, and the shell will display the result 3.

The IEx shell also provides a number of useful features, including:

- Tab completion: You can use tab completion to quickly complete module names, function names, and variable names.
- Documentation lookup: You can use the h command to look up documentation for a module, function, or macro. For example, h String will display the documentation for the String module.
- Debugging tools: You can use the i command to inspect the details of a data structure, and the s command to step through code one expression at a time.
The IEx shell is an essential tool for working with Elixir, and can help you quickly prototype and experiment with code.

## Example

Let's look at an example of using the IEx shell to explore the Elixir language. We'll start by opening the IEx shell and entering the following code:

```elixir
iex> 1 + 2
3
iex> 2 * 3
6
iex> 2 * 3 == 6
true
```
