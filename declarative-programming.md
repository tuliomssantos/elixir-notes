# Declarative Programming

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

## How to explain declarative programming for imperative programmers?

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on what the program should accomplish, rather than on how it should accomplish it. This is in contrast to imperative programming, which focuses on describing the steps needed to achieve a particular goal.

One way to explain declarative programming to imperative programmers is to use a real-world example. Let's say you want to make a cup of tea. In an imperative programming style, you would write a series of instructions:

- Fill the kettle with water.
- Turn on the kettle.
- Get a teabag and a mug.
- Put the teabag in the mug.
- When the kettle boils, pour the hot water over the teabag in the mug.
- Wait for the tea to steep for a few minutes.
- Remove the teabag from the mug.
-  Add sugar or milk if desired.

In contrast, a declarative programming style would simply state the end goal:

- Make a cup of tea.

The details of how to accomplish this goal are left to the computer to figure out.

Another way to explain declarative programming is to use SQL as an example. In SQL, you write queries that describe what data you want to retrieve, without specifying how to retrieve it. For example:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18

This query is declarative because it describes what data we want to retrieve (all users over the age of 18), but doesn't specify how to retrieve it. The database engine will figure out the most efficient way to retrieve the data based on the underlying data structures and indexes.
